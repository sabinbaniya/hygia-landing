## üéØ Why This Works

1. **Evidence‚Äëbacked engine**
   Drawing inspiration from apps like Yuka, which analyzes labels based on nutrition, additives, and organic status, Hygia‚ÄØLens relies on vetted databases and the latest research for scoring ([frontiersin.org][1], [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][2], [foodnavigator.com][3]).

2. **Time‚Äëefficient & user‚Äëfriendly**
   Studies show that quick barcode or label scanning saves time and increases compliance compared with manual food logging ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][4]).

3. **Behaviour-changing impact**
   Apps like Yuka empower users to pause, reassess, and often replace risky items, leading to healthier purchasing habits and increased product reformulation by brands ([wsj.com][5], [yuka.io][6]).

4. **Educational clarity**
   Clearly labeled ingredients and transparent ratings help users learn why something is flagged, be it an additive, allergen, or nutrient concern, much like Yuka does ([wcrf.org][7]).
